# Jellybeans Modified for Neovim

A sort of port of [jellybeans.vim](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim) for Neovim using Lua.

There are other ports of Jellybeans theme for Neovim but they divert a little when it comes to some colors.
This ports try to stay true to most colors but does diverge when it comes to spelling. Rather than having a solid background, undercurl is used.

Following plugins are supported

* [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
* [Rainbow-delimiters](https://github.com/HiPhish/rainbow-delimiters.nvim)
